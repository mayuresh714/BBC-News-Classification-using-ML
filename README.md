# BBC-News-Classification-using-ML
kaggle BBC news classify task

Text documents are one of the richest sources of data for businesses.

Weâ€™ll use a public dataset from the **BBC** comprised of 2225 articles, each labeled under one of 5 categories: business, entertainment, politics, sport or tech.

The dataset is broken into 1490 records for training and 735 for testing. The goal will be to build a system that can accurately classify previously unseen news articles into the right category.

## Summary of this Repo.
This data was analysed ,processed ,converted to vector form using **DOC2VEC gensim model**.
Then we trained it on different classification model like MLP,randomforest,logistic regression,etc. 
for different vector sizes 50,100,200,300 and noted that **MUltilayer perceptron** performed well in 
every case.So we saved the MLP model in .pickle file and used it in endproject (deployment time).

This was my accuracy score (pic from kaggle page) =>

to check how this model works on new article ,proceed as per following steps:<br/>
---> 1) run the app.py using **streamlit run app.py"** command (if it fails then for windows use *py -m streamlit run app.py*) <br/>
---> 2) pick up some article from google, paste it in text input section and press prdict button<br/>


You will get result like this one......
